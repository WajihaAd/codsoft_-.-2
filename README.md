## Functionality

- Users can perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) by clicking the corresponding buttons.
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan) are available for calculating the sine, cosine, and tangent of a given angle.
- The "C" button clears the input field.
- The "=" button evaluates the expression entered by the user and displays the result.

## Libraries Used

- **tkinter**: Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library used for creating the user interface.
- **math**: Python's standard mathematical library used for trigonometric calculations.
